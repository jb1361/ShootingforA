Our game is going to be a top-down shooter, that can be comparable to the Black Ops Arcade. 
Our prototype will be a man on a canvas with objects spawning to go towards him and whatever way the player rotates, itâ€™s shooting. 
Ideally the game should be finished with nice graphics of a player, and probably a scary setting with monsters constantly attacking.
The player will have a score based on how many kills it gets, and every interaction will be instant kill.
