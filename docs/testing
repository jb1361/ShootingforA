We are testing our code with UnityTestTools which implements Nunit testing library for C#.
To run the tests Just open up the EditorTestRUnner window in unity and right click run all tests. 
In all the tests the enviroment is set up then tested.
The way we set up the enviroment is done by first creating a new gameobject then adding and required classes for the test to that object.
We then set and variables to the instance of those classes to set up required values/arguments.
Finally we execute the method being tested then use NUnit assertions to test that the output is expected.
