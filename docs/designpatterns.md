The design pattern that we most using the singleton design patter and partially using the observer pattern.

We mainly use the singleton desing pattern with our many modules that each perform their own tasksbased on the given elements within our game.

We do implement the observer pattern with certain modules that need to continually check a state of another module and update accordingly.


We plan on designing modules with the singleton pattern to ensure that we can isolate and test the logic within the modules.
